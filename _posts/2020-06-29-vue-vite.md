Vite is the brand new development server proposed by the Vue framework - which can be used instead of the Vue CLI. This is a small **breakthrough** because it is the **first development server** associated with a main front-end framework that **doesn't use bundles**. Indeed, it uses ES module instead, on which, to some extend, relies Vue. Therefore, when a modification is made to the source code, Vite **updates the app in our browser instantaneously**. Also the **state** of the app is retained (like with HMR, see below). 

The server is so fast that it gives a sensation similar to when we, for example, change some style directly in the browser's console, which seriously improves front end developer experience by freeing us from waiting ü§ò. 

> Vite means 'fast' in French

> **Vue supports HMR**, so on update only a part of the app is recompiled into a bundle, and state can be retained. This is already pretty fast but does not compare with Vite, which is instantaneous.



### ES modules in browsers:


#### Before ES modules browser support, bundles were the best option:

Before supporting ES modules (or ‚ÄúJS modules‚Äù or ‚ÄúECMAScript modules‚Äù), so until 2017 / 2018, **browsers hadn‚Äôt any module system**. Actually, as you know, before ES6 there was **no official module system in JavaScript**. This led to great workaround built by the community (CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS‚Ä¶), but none were supported by browsers. 

So the **only way** to 'import' a script was to load it via **the `<script>` tag**: 
```
 <script type="text/javascript" src="/helloWorld.js"></script>
```
It was really limited in comparison with a module system, and made things extremely **complicated** as soon as scripts **had dependancies** (they had to be loaded in the right order, to be reachable from global scope‚Ä¶). And they were imported **as regular scripts and not as modules**.

 > Most important **differences between module and regular script** are that:
 -  a module has a lexical top-level scope (a variable declared in the module scope is not reachable from the global scope, as it would be the case with a regular script)
 - in a module, `this` doesn‚Äôt refer to the global `this` (but to `undefined`)
 - of course a module supports `import` and `export` syntaxe

On the other hand, **front-end frameworks** have been **using module systems** for long time :
 - their own system before ES6 (ex: Angular JS scope and dependency injection)
 - ES modules after 2015

Therefore, **bundlers**, which could understand a module system and compile it into a browser-understandable script, **were**, from far, **the best solution**, even for development servers. But, as we will see right now, **browsers share now the same module system** than most of JavaScript frameworks, which, at least for development environment, gives new possibilities.


#### Browser static modules implementation:

But, since 2018, all major browsers support ES modules. 

This means that now browsers can import modules. The first way is to use the 'good old' **the `script` tag**: 
 ```
 <script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>
 ```
But, to inform the browser that the script loaded **is a module**, we must give the new **`module` value** to the `type` attribute. This is generally used for importing **entry points**.


The second way is to use **the `import` syntax**:
```
import App from ‚Äú/js/app.js"
```

As with the `script` tag, this triggers an **HTTP request** to load the file `app.js`, which will be by default treated as a module - so in particular it can itself import modules. We can then import easily **nested dependencies**, which will be loaded layer by layer.

> As soon as there are few layers of dependencies, module imports can lead to cascade of HTTP requests. Therefore, this **not suitable for production** (for more details on module imports vs bundling you can have a look on [this (src: Google V8)](https://v8.dev/features/modules#performance) )

An other important specificity of the browser `import` implementation is the module specifier (the module path module): it must be an URL, **bare imports are not supported**.

Then, the browser works like a **standard module handler**: any new module fetch is added to a dictionary where it is keyed by URL. An important thing to notice though is that **any module is imported only once** (if it is required twice, the browser recognize its specifier and gets it from its storage). This point will be useful to understand how Vite browser updates work.

Then, when all the whole dependency graph has been loaded, modules are instantiated (from the most nested to the top), their exports are made available, and only then the uppest code will be executed.


#### Browser dynamic modules implementation:

In accordance with ES modules specs, browsers also implement the `import()` method which enables dynamic imports - this method is asynchronous and returns a promise. Dynamically imported modules are added to the dictionary containing other modules, and can be used as soon as they are instanciated. As we will see, **Vite relies on this feature for updates**.

So we have seen now that browser and Vue apps share the same module system (with different implementations; we will see now how Vite takes advantage of this.

> For more information browser ES module implementation, please have a look on [this awesome in-depth article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/) from the Mozilla Team on how this works internally.

### The logic behind Vite:


#### Overview:

So, as mentioned previously, Vite **serves ES modules instead bundles**. Concretely how does it work ?

Let‚Äôs start with the beginning, the entry point and the entry module (cf Part I.):

```
  <script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>
```
```
// main.js

import { createApp } from '/@modules/vue'
import App from '/App.vue'
import '/index.css?import'

createApp(App).mount('#app')
```

And that‚Äôs all: **the whole app** will be, layer by layer, **imported from here as ES module**! Also, as you can see, this is extremely close to the main.js file in our source code: here only module specifiers have been changed to be browser compatible !

But there is a problem, we have two types of imports: 
 - Statements importing ES modules: the vue bundle (`/@modules/vue`) 
 > Of course, only the source code is imported as module, Vite uses the available bundles for  dependencies !
 - Statements importing 'things' which **are not ES modules**, such as: `.vue` files, CSS stylesheet...

So how does Vite deal with that ?

Here is a major feature of Vite: it **transforms on the fly the required resource into valid modules** thanks to a "pipe" of plugins performing various code transformations (which to some extend reminds webpack loaders used by Vue).
> There will be **more information** on this **in the next part**, which presents an overview of the compilation / transpillation of **Single File Components (SFC) into modules**.

The rest of the process is quite straightforward.

The browser imports, **layer by layer, the whole dependency graph** (cf Part I.). Then, when everything has been loaded, the browser **instantiates** from bottom (modules which do not have dependencies) to up (`main.js`) all the modules. So, when the **top script `main.js`** is executed, all **the dependancies are ready** to be used. Then we come back to the **standard bootstrap process**: the root Vue instance is created, which, in the process, recursively mounts all components (which have already been instanciated).


#### SFC compilation / transformation:

Concerning SFC, as we mentioned, Vite performs on the run the same kind of code transformation than what the Vue Webpack loader does. As you know, `.vue` files are divided into blocks (`script`, `template`, etc‚Ä¶). Concretely, **Vite transforms each bloc into modules**, which are dependencies of the ‚Äúscript‚Äù bloc module.

For this, Vite relies on **the Vue Compiler**, which, in particular, **parses `vue` files** into an objects (`FileDescriptor`) and produces **render functions**.

So, for example, it:
 - transforms templates into a module exporting a render function
 - transforms styles into a module exporting a CSS string
 - 

Here is a schema representing the three standard blocs of a SFC imported by Vite: 
When a block is imported, it replies to the request `/...hello.vue`. Then Vite returns this:
- extracts the `script` block, which is already a module, and in particular adds statements to import the other blocks /// the script block is imported first, and, in particular, imports and treatments of the other blocs have been added by Vite to the source code 
- the style block is then imported (the query parameter `type=style` has been added to the initial module specifier). It is compiled by Vite into a CSS string. Once loaded, it and will be added directly to the DOM through the function `updateStyle`(also added to the first block by Vite)
- the template block (module specifier + `?type=template`) is finally imported. It has been compiled on the fly by Vite into a render function, which is then added to the component.

> Vite supports **TypeScript**, **JSX** and **CSS pre-processors**. It also supports **custom blocks** by allowing user to write its own plugins.

### How does Vite performs instantaneous browser updates ?


#### Vite re-imports modules where a modification has been made:

Vite, as any other dev server, watches files changes. When it detects some changes, it emits events (through a web socket), like this one:
```
{path: "/components/HelloWorld.vue",
timestamp: 1590935911313,
type: "vue-reload"}
```

As you can see, this message contains a **file path**. This is the **module specifier of the module to update**.

Then, in the event listener (located in the module responsible for opening the web socket, imported as ‚Äòhmr‚Äô) : 

```
// hmr
// in case of a type ‚Äúvue-reload‚Äù
        case 'vue-reload':
            import(`${path}?t=${timestamp}`)
                .then((m) => {
                __VUE_HMR_RUNTIME__.reload(path, m.default);
                console.log(`[vite] ${path} reloaded.`);
            })
                .catch((err) => warnFailedFetch(err, path));
            break;
```
*[Here](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/master/src/client/client.ts) is the source code.*

Vite leverages here **ES6 dynamic modules imports** (cf Part I.) and imports directly the modules containing the update. 

So, in addition to skipping any bundling process, thanks to the granularity offered by the module system, it can precisely provide the very piece of code updated.

*Why is there a timestamp in the URL passed to the `import` function ?
Because browsers register modules into a Map where they are keyed by URL. So, if we passed only the URL to the `import` function, the browser would recognize it and it would directly return the module which has been stored during the bootstrap of the app.*

Then, the we come back to a standard behaviour: the imported module is passed either to a Vue dependency ( `__VUE_HMR_RUNTIME__`), which will update the virtual DOM, or, in case of CSS updates, will directly update the DOM.


#### No dependency is re-imported:

But what happens when the updated component has dependencies, and presents import statements ? Are they re-imported as well ?

Of course not, and here **again Vite takes advantage of ES modules**: when it returns an updated module, it doesn‚Äôt change the URL of its dependencies. Since the browser recognizes the dependancies module specifiers, it will fetch in its module cache instead of triggering an HTTP request to import them.

*And what if a module is modified and one of its dependancies at the same time ? These modifications are handled in two different sequences (two distinct events are emitted).*



### So how can I migrate my Vue app to use Vite ?

Unfortunately, currently Vite doesn't seem to offer any way 'out of the box' to 'migrate' an existing app from the Vue CLI to Vite. Also, Vite is compatible with Vue 3 only. Maybe the Vue team will choose to integrate Vite directly into a future Vue release. Anyways, as soon as more information is available, this will be updated here. 

Also, more concrete examples on features where the behaviour is not completely similar with the Vue CLI : worker configuration, 
+ Vite configuration


### Summary:

Vite is a development server based on **ES modules** instead of **bundles**. This provides on start a very reduced compilation time, and, most important, this gives, on source code update, the possibility of **directly updating** modules that have been modified **instead of re-bundling** all or part of the source-code.

For this, Vite directly returns ES modules and compile other resources on the fly. In particular, it transforms each bloc of a SFC into ES modules, relying on the Vue compiler.

This is, of course, only worth / valuable for a development environment (because of the HTTP requests cascade), but Vite offers a production build (based on Rollup). For now, it is still experimental, but we are looking forward to further developments, and, perhaps, an integration in the Vue CLI. But one thing is sure: this will much improve front-end experience.
