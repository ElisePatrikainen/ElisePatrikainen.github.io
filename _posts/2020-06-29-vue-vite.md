Vite (which means ‘fast’ in French) is the new Vue development server based on **ES modules** instead of **bundles**.

Perhaps it doesn’t sound so exciting, said so, but getting rid of the bundling step offers advantages : 
 - a very reduced compilation time
 - on source code update, the possibility of **directly updating** modules that have been modified **instead of re-bundling** all or part of the source-code

Result, the server is worth its name: it is so fast that it **literally updates instantly the browser** on source code update (and of course it retains the state). This definitely can speed up development, especially on big apps, and, honestly, it **dramatically increases front-end developer experience**: bye bye waiting [ rocket]


*Nb: Vue supports HMR, so on update only a part of the app is recompiled into a bundle, and state can be retained. This is already pretty fast but does not compare with Vite, which is instantaneous.*

### ES modules in browsers (why do we need bundles):

#### Before ES modules browser support (2017 / 2018):

Before supporting ES modules (or “JS modules” or “ECMAScript modules”), browsers hadn’t any module system. Actually, as you know, before ES6 there was no official module system in JavaScript. This led to great workaround built by the community (CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS…), but none were supported by browsers. 

So the only way to “import” a dependency was to load it via the `<script>` tag: 
```
 <script type="text/javascript" src="/helloWorld.js"></script>
```
It was really limited in comparison with a module system, and made things extremely complicated as soon as there were several scripts which depended on each other (they had to be loaded in the right order, be reachable from global scope…). // Differences scripts / modules
